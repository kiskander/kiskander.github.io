      <description>TensorFlow Extended(TFX) gives you the power of building a end to end machine learning pipeline. However it is somewhat difficult to grasp the ideas coupled with the actual codebase, and it is non trivial to write an entire machinie learning project from scratch.
The main advantage of using TFX CLI is that you can get a fully working end to end example out of the box. Also, many customizable points are already included such as how to leverage BigQuery, Vertex AI Training/Serving, Dataflow GCP infrastructure.</description>
