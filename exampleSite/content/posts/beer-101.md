# Brew Beer Fundamentals  

## Step 01: Milling the grain
Duration: 0:02:00

Beginning In the brew house, different types of malt are crushed together to break up the grain kernels in order to extract fermentable sugars to produce a milled product called grist.

```python
import json 

print("making beer is fun")

```




## Step 02: Mash Conversion

`The grist is then transferred into a mash turn` 
> where it is mixed with heated water in a process called mash conversion. The conversion process uses natural enzymes in the malt to break the malt’s starch down into sugars.




## Step 03: Lautering

The mash is then pumped into the lauter tun, where a sweet liquid (known as wort) is separated from the grain husks.



## Step 04: The boil

The wort is then collected in a vessel called a kettle, where it is brought to a controlled boil before the hops are added.

## Step 05: Wort separation and cooling

After boiling, the wort is transferred into a whirlpool for the wort separation stage. During this stage, any malt or hop particles are removed to leave a liquid that is ready to be cooled and fermented.

### Let's ferment!


## Step 06: Fermentation

To start the fermentation, yeast is added during the filling of the vessel. Yeast converts the sugary wort into beer by producing alcohol, a wide range of flavors, and carbon dioxide (used later in the process to give the beer its sparkle).



## Step 07: Maturation

After fermentation, the young “green” beer needs to be matured in order to allow both a full development of flavors and a smooth finish.


## Step 08: Filtration, carbonation, and cellaring

After reaching its full potential, the beer is filtered, carbonated, and transferred to the bright beer tank, where it goes through a cellaring process that takes 3-4 weeks to complete. Once completed, the beer is ready to be packaged (and that’s a whole other fascinating process explained in the video).
